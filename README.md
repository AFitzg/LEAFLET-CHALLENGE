Leaflet Homework - Visualizing Data with Leaflet
Goal is to visualize a USGS earthquake. 
Pulled GeoJson data from the USGS website for earthquakes over the last 7 days.

To visualize the data, a map needed to be created using Leaflet that showd splots of all of the earthquakes from the last 7 days data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Created map layers using leaflet to show earthquake layer on dark and street maps. Earthquake data was shown via markers. On click, markers display a brief overview of key earthquake details. Markers reflected the magnitude of the earthquake via the size of the radius, higher magnitudes had a larger radius and lower magnitudes had a smaller radius. The depth was reflected via marker color intensity. The deeper the earthquake the darker the marker.

A legend was created to provide context for the map and show earthquake details shown via the marker size and color.
