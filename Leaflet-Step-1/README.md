D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3
The point of this challenge was to be able to use D3 to plot certain elements pulled from the data in the provided csv. We had to take two factors (healthcare vs poverty) that were classified by state and plot those points onto a graph. We had to create axis lables for the graph as well as customize the plots/circles that needed to be plotted.

SVG, d3.csv, and linear scales are major components of this exercise.  I had to create an SVG wrapper that provided me with an area for my graph, then I had to ensure the margins were correct. I had to import the data via the csv and parse for only the two columns that I planned on plotting.  I then had to create scalar functions that would allow my x and y axis to be defined via the domain pulled from the max numbers within the two fields I would be using to plot.  Once the axes were appended to the chart I had to create circles which represented data points based on the two columns I plotted. A data point was created for each state. Then I had to create circle lables so the state abbreviation was displayed on the correct circe. Certain attributes had to be factored in to ensure the labels fit onto the circles.
